            Thinking about the ever-growing list of the things I am most
            thankful about you, fitting it all in this one letter is basically
            impossible. I get emotional thinking about the things you do for me.
            So lucky to have met a friend like you in this lifetime :(
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            Sometimes I think about me not being the most ideal friend, I had my
            shortcomings, I made mistakes, there was a time na I gave up trying
            to be a part of your life, I was selfish, thought only about myself,
            and I just really am sorry na I didn’t understand things enough.
            Pero after all this, I am very thankful na our friendship had
            another chance and that I still get to be a part of your life again
            :'(
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            You never fail to amaze me with your kindness and unconditional
            love. You're the friend I look up to the most, you're so strong and
            such a good soul above all else. Whenever I feel sad and down, you
            always hear me out, always making me feel better. You make me
            comfortable to be my true self. Thank you for making life easier for
            me, you are my forever person. ♡
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I wouldn’t trade our friendship for anything else. Without a doubt,
            you are the Rachel to my Monica. Or the Phoebe to my Rachel. Or the
            Monica to my Phoebe? You get it hahaha
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            Really sad na I cannot physically be there and see you to celebrate
            your special day, pero I know you’ll be the first one I’ll see once
            this covid is over. Virtually sending you all my love!! Your family,
            me, and your other friends celebrate your life on this very special
            day. Happy birthday to you, Alyssa. You deserve all the love and
            happiness and all the sushi bakes in this world. I love you <3
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
